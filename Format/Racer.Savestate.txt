.e1rs

v1 = pod + pod data classes data read/write, foundation for expansion into other data sets

-> HEADER
0x00	0x10	magic word
			\211 S W E 1 R S A V S T A \r \n \032 \n
			0x8953574531525341565354410D0A1A0A
0x10	0x1	file format version
0x11	0x1	format version required for loading
0x12	0x1	endianness
0x13	0x4	data length (byte after header to byte before eof marker)
0x17	0x2	data offset
0x19	0x4	CRC32 hash (0x00 to 0x18)

-> DATA
[loop start] data blocks
	0x00	0x1	type ID (i.e. basis for pointer path building)
				0 = pod info (struct with lap times, etc.)
				1 = pod state (struct with speed, coord, etc.)
				...following not implemented in v1
				2 = race info?
				3 = environment objects? destructible terrain etc.
				...room to expand
	0x01	0x4	set offset (number of bytes from pointer to start writing data)
	0x05	0x4	length of data in block
	0x09	0x?	the data
	0x??	0x4	CRC32 hash (type id byte to last byte of data)
[loop end]
0x??	0x4	CRC32 hash (byte after header checksum to byte before this)

0x??	0x8	EOF marker - .DOTDONE (0x2E444F54444F4E45)
